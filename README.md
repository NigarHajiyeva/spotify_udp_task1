# UDP based application

Basic CLI application.

This application shows communication between server and client over UDP protocol. 



## Scenario

The Spotify regional server warehouse provides music streaming services for the billions of
clients 24/7. Spotify servers responding time are depend on clients load number. Because of this reason,
the clients must wait for responding with regarding the next time schedule:

- *First interval: Between 12:00 â€“ 17:00 the maximum wait time must be 2 seconds*

- *Second Interval: After the 17:00 till the 23:59 the maximum wait time must be for 4 seconds*

- *Third Interval: After the 23:59 till the 12:00 of the next day the waiting time must be 1 second*

The exponential backoff of these intervals must be increased by the next factors:

- For the first and third intervals: doubles each iteration

- For the second interval: triples on each iteration
